#pyFAST - FAST Framework python implementation

## Details
This repository is Python reimplementation of [FAST Framework](http://www.mit.edu/~sze/fast.html)
This code doesn't work yet, all functions were recompiled from matlab by [SMOP](https://github.com/victorlei/smop) and I'm rewriting them one by one.
I'll appreciate any help or pull requests.

### Prerequisites

Super-resolution model for testing is built with tensorflow==2.0.1
```
pip install tensorflow
or
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```
