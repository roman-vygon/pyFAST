This repository is Python reimplementation of FAST Framework described here - http://www.mit.edu/~sze/fast.html
This code doesn't work yet, all functions were recompiled from matlab by SMOP (https://github.com/victorlei/smop) and I'm rewriting them one by one.
I'll appreciate any help and pull requests.
